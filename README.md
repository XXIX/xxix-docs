## You better love writing Markdown

### What you need to know
+ All posts are compiled from Markdown files which are saved in the `_posts` folder.
+ Posts are order by date, in ascending order (oldest first)
+ Post dates are pulled from the file name, e.g. `2014-11-16-getting-started.md` has the date 16th November 2014.
+ Post titles are pulled from the file name, e.g. `2014-11-16-getting-started.md` has the title ‘Getting Started’
+ If something isn’t being compiled properly add an extra line break, Markdown loves line breaks.

### Images

To add images, simply drop them in `/img` and link to them from your post. Use the format `![alttag](img/filename.png)`.

***

### Captions

Captions sit out in the right hand side gutter when there’s enough room. To create a caption, you need to wrap the content block in a div and use a block quote.

For example, the following:

<div markdown="1">
  ![My Image](img/screenshot.png)

> #### Caption title  
With some content underneath.
</div>

Can be created by:

{% highlight html %}
<div markdown="1">
  ![My Image](img/screenshot.png)

> #### Caption title  
With some content underneath.
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

***

### Code snippets

Jekyll has built-in support for syntax highlighting of code snippets. To include a code snippet in any post, just use the dedicated Liquid tags.

For example, the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Can be created by:

{% raw %}
{% highlight ruby %}  
def show  
&nbsp;&nbsp;@widget = Widget(params[:id])  
&nbsp;&nbsp;respond_to do |format|  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;format.html # show.html.erb  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;format.json { render json: @widget }  
&nbsp;&nbsp;end  
end  
{% endhighlight %}  
{% endraw %}
